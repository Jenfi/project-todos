# Todo app

This project has been made with React Redux using useDispatch and useSelector hooks. It also uses useState-hooks.


## Process
I started with sketching up the project and breaking it up into smaller components. After that I set up the store and provider and then I took one component at a time.
If I had more time I would have added a state to the checked boxes and revised the count of total todos into total todos not checked.
